# RAG Step-by-Step

This is a working example of [Frank Denneman's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankdenneman/) article [RAG Architecture Deep Dive](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rag-architecture-deep-dive-frank-denneman-4lple/) which defines the Load-Transform-Embed-Store workflow. For building RAG applications.

There are thre examples. The [open source example](/RAG_opensource/) uses Ollama, llama2, and PostgeSQL with pgvector. The [SaSS example](./RAG_SaSS/) uses OpenAI GPT3.5 and Pinecone. The [RAG with Web Searcg](/RAG_web_search/) demonstrates performing RAG with data from a search engine.
