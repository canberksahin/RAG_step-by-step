# RAG Step-by-Step

This is a working example of [Frank Denneman's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankdenneman/) article [RAG Architecture Deep Dive](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rag-architecture-deep-dive-frank-denneman-4lple/) which defines the Load-Transform-Embed-Store workflow. For building RAG applications.

There are two examples. The [open source example](/RAG_opensource/) uses Ollama, llama2, and PostgeSQL with pgvector. The [SaSS example](./RAG_SaSS/) uses OpenAI GPT3.5 and Pinecone.

[RAG Step-by-Step](https://dev.to/spara_50/rag-step-by-step-3fof) covers the SaSS example.

[RAG Step-by-Step with Open Source]() covers the open source example.
